history
Twitters origins lie in a daylong brainstorming session held by board members of the podcasting company 
Odeo Jack Dorsey then an undergraduate student at New York University introduced the idea of an individual 
using an SMS service to communicate with a small group The original project code name for the service was twttr 
the disemvowelled version of the word twitter an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass inspired by Flickr and the fivecharacter length of American SMS short codes
The decision was also partly due to the fact that the domain twittercom was already in use and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain
and changed the name of the service to Twitter The developers initially considered 10958 as a short code but later changed it to 40404 for ease of use and memorability 
Work on the project started on March 21 2006 when Dorsey published the first Twitter message at 1250 pm PST UTC−0800 just setting up my twttr Dorsey has explained the origin of the Twitter title.

first prototype
The first Twitter prototype developed by Dorsey and contractor Florian Weber was used as an internal service for Odeo employees
The full version was introduced publicly on July 15 2006 
In October 2006 Biz Stone Evan Williams Dorsey and other members of Odeo formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo together with its assetsincluding Odeocom and Twittercomfrom the investors and shareholders Williams fired Glass who was silent about his part in Twitters startup until 2011
Twitter spun off into its own company in April 2007 Williams provided insight into the ambiguity that defined this early period in a 2013 interview.
